# 🚀 SLAB.AI 2.0 - Lead to Learning Platform

A modern, cloud-native EdTech platform with complete DevOps implementation - from infrastructure automation to production deployment.

## 🎯 Business Value

- **Lead Conversion** - Capture and nurture learner interest into paid enrollments
- **Scalable Infrastructure** - Handle campaign spikes with auto-scaling
- **Enterprise Security** - Protect PII and payment data with zero-trust architecture
- **Measurable Performance** - API p95 < 300ms, global CDN delivery

## 🏗️ Production Architecture
CloudFront → ALB → EKS Cluster → MongoDB Atlas
↑
Frontend (React) + Backend (Node.js)
Nginx Proxy → Backend API

## 🚀 DevOps Implementation

### ✅ Infrastructure as Code
cd infrastructure/terraform/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

✅ Completed: VPC, EKS Cluster, ECR Repositories, S3 Buckets, Load Balancers

✅ Kubernetes Deployment

# Cluster access
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ca-central-1 --name slab-ai-dev-dev
# Application deployment
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
✅ Deployed: Backend API (2 replicas), Frontend React App (2 replicas), Services, LoadBalancer

✅ Production Evidence
EKS Cluster: slab-ai-dev-dev in ca-central-1 (2 worker nodes)
Backend APIs: Leads, Courses, Auth, Payments fully operational
Frontend: Accessible via LoadBalancer with nginx proxy
Services: Internal service discovery working
Health Checks: All pods running with zero restarts

## 🛡️ Security Features
Input validation with express-validator
JWT authentication with secure token storage
Helmet security headers
CORS configuration
Private networking with service isolation
Health checks and readiness probes

## 📊 API Endpoints (✅ VERIFIED WORKING)
GET /health - System health
POST /api/leads - Capture leads
GET /api/leads - List leads  
GET /api/courses - List courses
POST /api/auth/register - User registration
POST /api/payments/create-intent - Payment processing

## 🎯 Deployment Success Metrics
✅ Infrastructure: EKS cluster with 2 worker nodes
✅ Applications: Backend + Frontend deployed successfully
✅ Networking: LoadBalancer provisioned with external access
✅ Reliability: All pods healthy, zero crash loops
✅ Scalability: Multiple replicas with rolling updates
✅ API Connectivity: Frontend → Nginx Proxy → Backend working perfectly

## 🔧 Quick Start
Local Development
# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

Production Deployment (✅ PROVEN WORKING)
# 1. Infrastructure
cd infrastructure/terraform/
terraform apply -auto-approve
# 2. Cluster access  
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ca-central-1 --name slab-ai-dev-dev
# 3. Deploy applications
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
# 4. Access production
kubectl get service slab-ai-frontend-lb -n slab-ai
